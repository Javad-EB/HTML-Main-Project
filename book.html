                            <p>Legendary leadership and elite performance expert Robin Sharma introduced The 5am Club concept over twenty years ago, based on a revolutionary morning routine that has helped his clients maximize their productivity, activate their best health and bulletproof their serenity in this age of overwhelming complexity</p>
                            <p><em> Rules: </em>The 5am club strategy asks you to get out of bed at 5am six till seven times per week. The first action you then execute is sports. Robin suggests running or going to the gym for 20 minutes. In a second step you invest 20 minutes in your education.</p>
